                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>My name is Tomasz Łukaszyk. I used to work as sanitary installations designer (engineer) for 9 years, but I always had a passion for programming
                    ever since my first adventure with Turbo Pascal in high school. I was always fond of puzzles and logical chalanges. I've started a course at 
                    <a href="https://codecool.pl/">Codecool</a> Kraków school of programming with intent to change my career.

                <h1>Python</h1>
                <p>I've started my course by learning basic programming concepts using Python. Thanks to specific nature of its syntax I taught myself to write clean 
                    and ordered code. I learned about variables, data types, lopps, flow of control and how to divide code to functions. How to interact with user through
                    console and how to store and recover data from file. How to solve algorithmic problems, how to optimise thier execution and how to plan and structure 
                    an application.

                <h1>Java</h1>
                <p>Java was the first object oriented programming language that I learned. It has become my main focus and I'm still deepening my knowledge.
                    Thus far I've learned how to build proper class structure using simple data objects, and more complex ones containing logic. How to use encapsulation
                    and abstraction to hide the data and implementation to give only acces to what is relevant. How to properly use inheritance and interfaces to make 
                    polimorphic objects that are true to SOLID principles. How to use popular code writing patterns like: iterator, MVC, factory. How to use java collections
                    framework to benefit performance. Currently I'm getting to know JDBC interface and how to handle http requests.

                <h1>HTML + CSS</h1>
                <p>This site is my first attempt at using HTML5 and CSS3 during this course. I've modeled this code after only a few days reading into w3c schools guide
                    so I realize it's not perfect. I tried to do my best to follow best practises and to make the site responsive and attractive. There is also a bit of
                    JavaScript in the mix used for validation of form in contact page.

                <h1>Android</h1>
                <p>Before joining Codecool I was lucky enough to be one of the recipients of Google Developer Challange Scholarship. After 3 months of learning and chalanges
                    I was able to qualify to the next phase and earned access to full Android Basics Nanodegree course. I learned much about Android framework using java and
                    developed several fully functioning application. I graduated earning official certificate.
